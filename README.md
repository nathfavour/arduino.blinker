## ⚙️ What is Blinker?

Blinker is an Arduino sketch designed to make your LED blink in a specific repeating pattern. It's perfect for:

*   Learning Arduino basics 💡
*   Creating visual alerts 🔔
*   Adding flair to your projects 🎉

## 🚀 Features

*   **Customizable Blink Patterns:** Easily modify the `blinkForDuration` function to create your own unique blinking sequences. ✍️
*   **Simple and Easy to Use:** Just upload the code to your Arduino board and watch the magic happen! ✨
*   **Clear and Concise Code:** The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it perfect for beginners. 👨‍🎓

## 🛠️ Hardware Required

*   Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) 🤖
*   LED (built-in or external) 💡
*   (Optional) Resistor (if using an external LED)  resistor

## 🔌 Setup

1.  **Connect your LED:**
    *   If using the built-in LED, no additional connections are needed.
    *   If using an external LED, connect it to a digital pin on your Arduino board with a resistor in series.
2.  **Open the sketch:** Open the `blinker.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3.  **Select your board and port:** In the Arduino IDE, select your board type and port.
4.  **Upload the code:** Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to your Arduino board. 📤

## ⚡ Usage

Once the code is uploaded, the LED will start blinking in the repeating pattern: three blinks in one second, then one blink in the next second.

You can modify the `blinkForDuration` function to change the number of blinks and the duration of each blink. Experiment with different values to create your own unique blinking patterns! ✍️
